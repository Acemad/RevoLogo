                    <p>                    
                    Simply fill out the <a href="request.php">logo design request form</a>,
                    making sure to 
                    include accurate and relevant information about the entity you wish 
                    to design its logo.<br><br>
                    <strong>Most important things you will be asked for</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>E-Mail</strong> - It's important to include a valid e-mail address
                    that you can check frequently, as it'll serve as a mean to contact you, and
                    convey important design-process updates. All logo concepts and even final
                    files will be delivered via e-mail.<br>
                    <strong>Entity Name</strong> - If, for example you want to design the logo
                    of a company (as the entity), the official name of that company is the 
                    entity's name,
                    this may include the full name, such as 'MyCompany, LLC'. 
                    Same thing can be said for a product, a website, or any entity. <br>
                    <strong>Name on Logo</strong> - This depends on how you want to market
                    your brand, it's simply the plain-text name you would like to see 
                    in the form of a logo. This can be only initials, a part of, or whole
                    name of the company.<br><br>
                    Payment of a modest 'logo design &amp; research' fee of $19.95 is 
                    required upon completion of this step. (through PayPal)<br>
                    Information you provide in this step is treated as a private design
                    brief, 
                    and is not to be shared with any third-party or whatsoever.

                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>
                    Having received your logo design request, our designers will immediately start
                    a logo design process for your entity (brand).<br><br>
                    First, the information you provided previously is analysed thoroughly, then
                    some design ideas are proposed and then materialized as logo concepts. 
                    These concepts (usually 3 to 5) will then be sent to you via the e-mail
                    address you provided earlier.<br><br>                
                    You are tasked to evaluate and decide which direction must be taken
                    based on which logo concept in the next step. You can even ask 
                    for another concept.<br><br>
                    Designing logo concepts may take up to a maximum of 72 hours.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>
                    The designed concepts are based on the information you provided,
                    and are made to look awesome and satisfy your business needs.
                    You will have to select a concept that you judge the most adequate for 
                    your business, you can then ask to apply tweaks and adjustments as you see
                    fit (if any), these tweaks include : <br>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Changing colors</li>
                        <li>Modifying layout</li>
                        <li>Modifying typeface</li>
                        <li>Adding/Removing small details</li>
                        <li>Resizing</li>
                        <li>...etc</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    You select and tweak a concept by replying to the e-mail containing
                    initial logo concepts, or you can just send a message 
                    to [design @ revologo.com]
                    using the e-mail address you provided. Your message should include the concept's
                    number, and all the requested tweaks and adjustments needed.<br> 
                    Our designers will send you the tweaked version and work with you
                    until you're satisfied<br><br>
                    You may also ask for another concept based on the initial ones
                    or a completely new one, then apply tweaks.
                    
                    </p>

                    Upon satisfaction you may purchase the final logo files to be used
                    on any media type concerning your business. You will receive a packaged file
